                    The Give To Our City website contains pages featuring charities and other qualifying tax-exempt organizations registered as pre-approved to receive distributions (regrants)
                    of donor-advised contributions given to Firespring Foundation's donor advised fund (“Registered Charities”). The existence of these pages on the Give To Our City website does
                    not constitute as solicitation of donations by FI or FF; FI does not engage in any solicitation activities on behalf of any Registered Charity. If you are affiliated
                    with a Registered Charity, you may register to claim Administrative Access to the page featuring your organization by completing the form here:
                    Give To Our City website registration. Your user account with Administrative Access will allow you to function as the page admin of the Registered Charity, update
                    content on the Registered Charity page, and access donation and regrant reports for the charity.

                    Donating on the Give To Our City website
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    Tax-Deductible Contributions to Charitable Causes
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Donations made on the Give To Our City website in support of Registered Charities, projects of Registered Charities, or Charity Fundraisers (collectively, “Charitable
                    Causes”) are complete and final charitable gifts to the FF donor advised fund and are not refundable. FF is a Nebraska nonprofit, tax exempt charitable foundation
                    qualified as such under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code which maintains a donor-advised fund. A donor-advised fund (“DAF”) is a separate account of a
                    charity that receives completed gifts from donors while allowing them the privilege of advising on the distribution of their gift to other charities and charitable
                    causes. Normally your donation to a Charitable Cause made through the Give To Our City website goes to and will be receipted by FF as a donor-advised contribution. FF makes
                    every effort to honor donor advisements and is authorized to do so for advisements to public charities appearing on the Give To Our City website as Registered Charities.
                    Occasionally, for specific fundraising events, FF will collaborate with other local public charities. In those cases, the event website and other publicity will
                    indicate if contributions will be receipted directly by the local charity, instead of by FF.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is FF’s normal practice to retain 2.9% plus $0.30 cents per donation. FF makes every reasonable effort to respect the wishes of its donors. However, to comply with
                    federal tax laws and Internal Revenue Service regulations, FF must retain the exclusive authority, discretion, and legal control over all donated funds. In the rare
                    event that the charity you have selected does not satisfy Firespring Foundation’s criteria or otherwise does not enable or accept payment (reasons for this include
                    issues like: they don’t or cannot accept donations, are not recognized by the IRS as a public charity, or are not in good standing with federal or state regulators,
                    etc.), FF may select an alternate charity to receive your advised funds.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Charged Back or Refunded Donations
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In accordance with IRS regulations, the FF enforces a strict “No Refunds” policy for contributions made to the donor-advised fund. However, the FF recognizes
                    circumstances where reversal of one or more transactions may be necessary. These include Charge Back and Gross Error transactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Charge Back transaction occurs when the credit card holder files a dispute with their bank stating that either they did not authorize or recognize the transaction on
                    their credit card or bank statement. The FF staff will provide supporting documentation in an effort to resolve the Charge Back case in favor of the Foundation.
                    However, if the FF is unable to resolve such cases and the case is referred to arbitration, the FF will accept the Charge Back transaction. Further, the FF will, under
                    its variance power and authority, not regrant any funds to the selected organization that has been charged back. If the Charge Back funds have already been distributed
                    to the selected organization, , no attempt will be made to compel the organization to return the funds since the distribution  of a the donation advisement is
                    considered complete and unrestricted. However, the FF will not issue any further regrants of donor-advised funds until it receives additional funds from donors or other
                    sources advised for the organization equal to the amount of the Charge Back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Gross Error transaction occurs when the credit cardholder / donor makes a transaction for an amount grossly different than the intended amount. For example, a donor
                    makes a $10,000.00 donation instead of $10.00 donation. A Gross Error transaction DOES NOT include donation intended to be directed to one organization but  made to the
                    wrong organization or fundraising page, containing an incorrect name, dedication, or designation, or any other non-financial reason. FF retains sole authority to
                    determine the exact criteria of a Gross Error transaction. A Gross Error transaction refund will only be considered if FF has not yet regranted the funds to the
                    designated organization (see “Tax-Deductible Contributions to Charitable Causes” section for more information on regrants). Once funds are regranted, the donor should
                    contact the advised organization in order to attempt to correct the error.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Credit Card Anti-Laundering Policy
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Only the authorized credit card holder may donate on the Give To Our City website. A third party may not use the donor's card information or enter donations on behalf of the
                    donor. This practice is known as "credit card laundering" and violates Visa and MasterCard usage agreements. FI  may report any such abuses to the appropriate
                    authorities. This restriction does not preclude the use of computer terminals or kiosks, with access to the Give To Our City website, for the authorized credit card holder to
                    utilize in order to make a donation.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    No Goods and Services in Exchange for Donations to Charitable Causes
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Federal law prohibits charities from promising or providing goods and services (e.g., tickets to events or raffles) in exchange for making a donation to a donor advised
                    fund such as Firespring Foundation. FF may only accept pure contributions and not part gift and part sale transactions.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Privacy of Donor Information
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Privacy and security of donor information is of vital importance to us. We will not share names of donors with anyone other than the Client and the Registered
                    Charities, except in conformity with the policies set forth in this section of the Terms of Use and in no event will we, the Client and the Registered Charities ever
                    sell your information to anyone. When you contribute to any cause on the Give To Our City website, you grant us permission to access your donation records at any time and to
                    use the information you provide to process your donation. FI or FF will make available to the Client and the Registered Charity reports identifying, your name, address,
                    email, and transaction accounting details. FF, the Client and the Registered Charities that ultimately receive your donations shall have the right to identify and
                    publically acknowledge you as a donor in their discretion, unless you elect, at the time of your donation, to make the gift anonymous, in which case we, the Client and
                    the Registered Charity agree not to publically disclose your name or your gift.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are a Registered Charity Admin, donor information will be shared with you via a report accessible on your Registered Charity Page or Fundraising Page on the
                    Give To Our City website.

                    discussions of the parties. If any provision of these Terms shall be held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from
                    these Terms and will be deleted and replaced by a valid and enforceable provision which achieves, as far as possible, the same objectives as the severed provision was
                    intended to achieve. The remaining provisions of these terms and conditions shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver or forbearance to seek a remedy by any
                    party of any breach by any other party of any of its covenants, obligations and agreements hereunder shall be a waiver of any subsequent breach of any other covenant,
