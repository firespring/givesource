                <h2 id="faq1">What is Give To Our City?</h2>

                <p>
                    Give To Our City is a 24-hour event that encourages everyone to contribute to Our City and  nonprofit organizations
                    through a single online giving platform on Jan 1st. Give To Our City is coordinated by <a href="#"> The Greater Area
                    Foundation</a>, in partnership with local nonprofit organizations. Every donation given makes a bigger impact
                    because nonprofits also get a proportional share of a $350,000 challenge match fund provided by The Greater Area
                    Foundation and the sponsors listed below.
                </p>

                <h2 id="faq2">What is the goal?</h2>

                <p>
                    The purpose of Give To Our City is to promote philanthropy in Our City. There are three primary goals:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Introduce new donors to our nonprofit organizations.</li>
                    <li>Help Our City nonprofit organizations tell their stories and educate Our City about the positive impact they
                        have on our lives.</li>
                    <li>Shine a community spotlight on this day of charitable giving to raise a substantial amount of new money to
                        assist the local nonprofit network. </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Give To Our City is intended to be a bonus fundraising opportunity for local nonprofits in our community. It is not intended
                    to replace or interfere with donors’ gifts to a nonprofit organization that would be made in the regular
                    course of charitable giving.
                </p>

                <h2 id="faq3">How does it work?</h2>

                <p>
                    Online donations to participating charities will be accepted from 12:00am to 11:59pm on Jan 1st. Donations made online during
                    that 24-hour period will be updated in real time on the online leader board at <a href="#">Give To Our City website</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All donations on <a href="#">Give To Our City website</a> will be made to the <a href="#">Firespring Foundation</a>; a 501(c)(3)
                    tax-exempt organization which permits donors to advise a re-granting of their donations to other IRS recognized
                    qualifying 501(c)(3) organizations. Firespring Foundation will re-grant 97.1% of each contribution to the
                    qualifying organization as advised by the donor, retaining 2.9% plus $.30 per transaction for credit card
                    transaction costs. All donations are final and cannot be refunded.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Donations may also be made in person by cash or check at the  The Greater Area Foundation office from 8:00am to 5:00pm. Checks
                    must be written to “ The Greater Area Foundation” with the nonprofit name specified in the memo line. LCF
                    will charge the same 2.9% fee as Firespring Foundation, and direct fees received from offline gifts to discretionary
                    funds used for community grants to local nonprofits. LCF is unable to accept gifts from IRA accounts for
                    Give To Our City because of IRS restrictions on IRA qualifying distributions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nonprofit organizations will receive their donations (minus 2.9% fee), proportional share of the challenge match fund, and
                    a list of offline donors within approximately one month of the event.
                </p>

                <h2 id="faq4">Can I give before Jan 1st?</h2>

                <p>
                    Donations made at <a href="#">Give To Our City website</a> starting on Jan 1st will count toward the event
                    and be eligible for the challenge match fund.
                </p>

                <h2 id="faq5">Is there a minimum or maximum donation?</h2>

                <p>
                    The minimum donation for Give To Our City is $10. There is a maximum donation limit
                    of $10,000 per nonprofit per household to be eligible for matching funds.
                </p>

                <h2 id="faq6">Is there a limit to the amount an organization can receive?</h2>

                <p>
                    There is no maximum amount an organization may receive for Give To Our City.
                </p>

                <h2 id="faq7">Who is able to participate?</h2>

                <p>
                    Nonprofit organizations recognized by the IRS as 501(c)(3) public charities located in Lancaster County that serve the people
                    of Our City are eligible to register for Give To Our City. Nonprofits that have either
                    a Lancaster County address listed on their GuideStar record or most recent Form 990 are eligible. If the
                    GuideStar/Form 990 official address is outside Lancaster County, the nonprofit must have a physical office
                    space in Lancaster County other than a personal residence. Houses of worship and their foundations are excluded
                    from participating.
                </p>

                <h2 id="faq8">What if I can’t find my favorite nonprofit on the website?</h2>

                <p>
                    If you can’t find them on <a href="#">Give To Our City website</a>, then it's most likely that organization
                    did not register to participate. Encourage them to register by April 21 if they serve the people of Our City
                    and have a local office.
                </p>

                <h2 id="faq9">How do the match funds work?</h2>

                <p>
                    The  The Greater Area Foundation and the sponsors listed below are providing a $350,000 challenge match fund for the event.
                    Credit card donations made through <a href="#">Give To Our City website</a> between May
                    1st and Jan 1st, and cash/check donations made in person at the  The Greater Area Foundation office from
                    8:00am to 5:00pm on Jan 1st, will be used to calculate the distribution of the match funds. The amount of
                    a nonprofit organization's share of the match fund will be based on the percentage of donations the nonprofit
                    receives of the total online and offline contributions made on Give To Our City. For example, if a nonprofit
                    receives 1% of the total contributions from the event, that organization will receive 1% of the match fund.
                </p>

                <h2 id="faq10">When will the nonprofit know about my donation?</h2>

                <p>
                    Your nonprofit will receive notice of your online donations in real-time and have access to a full donation report during
                    and after Give To Our City. Nonprofits will receive notice of any offline gifts from the  The Greater Area
                    Foundation within one month of the event. You have the option to give anonymously (online or offline) if
                    you choose to do so. Donations will be disbursed to the nonprofits within approximately one month of the
                    event.
                </p>

                <h2 id="faq11">How do I get a tax receipt?</h2>

                <p>
                    Your online gift tax receipt is e-mailed to you immediately by Firespring Foundation upon successful processing of your donation.
                    To claim a donation as a deduction on your U.S. taxes, please retain your email donation receipt as an official
                    record. For offline gifts,  The Greater Area Foundation will mail a tax receipt to you within 30 days of
                    the event.
                </p>

                <h2 id="faq12">What were the results in 2016?</h2>

                <p>
                    The fifth Give To Our City was held on Jan 1st, 2016. $3.1 million dollars were raised to help our local nonprofit community.
                    Thousands of individuals made donations to 348 local nonprofit organizations.
                </p>

                <h2 id="faq13">What if I have additional questions or concerns?</h2>
