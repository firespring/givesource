# Givesource
Givesource® is a platform designed to help foundations manage Giving Day events by allowing participating nonprofits to easily create a page and take donations.
Leveraging Amazon Web Services, Givesource® was built using a serverless architecture to support high site traffic and donor activity.
This means you have unlimited capacity to help nonprofits fundraise and grow your community without managing expensive servers.
