**Terms of Use**

Last Updated / Effective Date: 04/14/2017 

**Summary**

Welcome to the `<WEBSITE_NAME>` website (the “Giving Day Website”) operated by Firespring, Inc.  (“Firespring,” “FI”, “we,”, or “us”). By using the Giving Day Website, either as a donor or as the administrator for a Registered Charity (“you”), you acknowledge that you are at least 18 years of age, that you desire to make or the Registered Charity you represent desires to receive a charitable contribution and have read and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use (the “Terms”).   Such Terms include all technical specifications, rules of operation, security procedures, and any other terms and conditions published by Firespring or Firespring Foundation from time to time through the link on the Giving Day Website. Nothing in these Terms may be construed to create or confer any rights in any of your third party beneficiaries. **If you do not agree to any of the terms and conditions set forth herein, do not use the Giving Day Website.**

**Who We Are**

**Firespring, Inc. (FI)**

Firespring, Inc. is a Nebraska for-profit corporation that provides software as a service (SaaS) for FF and other nonprofit organizations, foundations and charities. FI developed, offers and maintains a website platform that facilitates donor designated charitable giving (the “Platform”). FI is willing to license the Platform to FF and Client for use in connection with FF’s collaboration with Client and is willing to provide the Client technical and administrative services described in this Agreement. 

**Firespring Foundation (FF)**

Firespring Foundation is a Nebraska nonprofit, tax-exempt charitable foundation qualified as such under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code which operates a donor advised fund to administer  donor advised contributions made through  the Giving Day Website. 

**Client**

The Client is typically a prominent nonprofit tax-exempt charitable foundation qualified as such under IRC §501(c)(3). Clients  enter into an agreement with FI and FF to use FI’s Giving Day Website Platform and  take  the lead to conduct fundraising campaigns (the “Giving Events”) at least once a year that are intended to raise funds for a wide range of reputable nonprofit organizations (Registered Charities) that it desires to benefit in its community. The Client is featured prominently on the Giving Day Website during the Giving Event.  

**Eligibility and Registration**

If you choose to create an account with us as a donor to make a donation to a Registered Charity, you will be asked to provide an email address and password. 

You are responsible for all activities occurring under your email address and for keeping your login and password secure. We may refuse to grant you access with a login that (i) impersonates someone else, (ii) may be protected by trademark or proprietary rights law, or (iii) is vulgar, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any attempt to access restricted areas without authorization is prohibited. You agree that if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or other security breach, you will notify us immediately by emailing support@firespring.com.

If you create an account with us, we or the Client, or the Registered Charities you choose may send a monthly newsletter, system messages pertaining to account information, and other communications to your email. You may opt out of the monthly newsletter at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link on the newsletter email.

This site is intended solely for individuals 18 years of age or older or organizations or Registered Charities. Any use or access of the site from persons under 18 is strictly prohibited. We will terminate and block access to the Giving Day Website  of any  persons  that we discover are not at least 18 years of age, or who or which otherwise violate these Terms of Use. 

**Fundraising on the Firespring Giving Day Website**  

**Registered Charities and Administrative Access**

The Giving Day Website contains pages featuring charities and other qualifying tax-exempt organizations registered as pre-approved to receive distributions (regrants) of donor-advised contributions given to Firespring Foundation's donor advised fund (“Registered Charities”). The existence of these pages on the Giving Day Website does not constitute as solicitation of donations by FI or FF; FI does not engage in any solicitation activities on behalf of any Registered Charity. If you are affiliated with a Registered Charity, you may register to claim Administrative Access to the page featuring your organization by completing the form here: [`<WEBSITE_NAME>`/register](`<WEBSITE_NAME>`/register). Your user account with Administrative Access will allow you to function as the page admin of the Registered Charity, update content on the Registered Charity page, and access donation and regrant reports for the charity.

By claiming Administrative Access for a Registered Charity, you agree that: 

*   You have authority to represent the Registered Charity in completing this registration 
*   You will provide true, accurate, and complete information through the Giving Day Website. 
*   You are solely liable and responsible for all actions taken via your user account. 
*   You are either an employee or volunteer of the Registered Charity, and are not an independent contractor receiving any form of compensation for these fundraising activities conducted on the Giving Day Website. 
*   You do not have authority to act on behalf of, speak for, or obligate FI, or FF in any manner, except to use authorized FI online tools and materials to raise funds through the Giving Day Website. 

**Donating on the Giving Day Website**

**Tax-Deductible Contributions to Charitable Causes**

Donations made on the Giving Day Website in support of Registered Charities, projects of Registered Charities, or Charity Fundraisers (collectively, “Charitable Causes”) are complete and final charitable gifts to the FF donor advised fund and are not refundable. FF is a Nebraska nonprofit, tax exempt charitable foundation qualified as such under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code which maintains a donor-advised fund. A donor-advised fund (“DAF”) is a separate account of a charity that receives completed gifts from donors while allowing them the privilege of advising on the distribution of their gift to other charities and charitable causes. Normally your donation to a Charitable Cause made through the Giving Day Website goes to and will be receipted by FF as a donor-advised contribution. FF makes every effort to honor donor advisements and is authorized to do so for advisements to public charities appearing on the Giving Day Website as Registered Charities. Occasionally, for specific fundraising events, FF will collaborate with other local public charities. In those cases, the event website and other publicity will indicate if contributions will be receipted directly by the local charity, instead of by FF.  

It is FF’s normal practice to retain 2.9% plus $0.30 cents per donation. FF makes every reasonable effort to respect the wishes of its donors. However, to comply with federal tax laws and Internal Revenue Service regulations, FF must retain the exclusive authority, discretion, and legal control over all donated funds. In the rare event that the charity you have selected does not satisfy Firespring Foundation’s criteria or otherwise does not enable or accept payment (reasons for this include issues like: they don’t or cannot accept donations, are not recognized by the IRS as a public charity, or are not in good standing with federal or state regulators, etc.), FF may select an alternate charity to receive your advised funds. 

**Charged Back or Refunded Donations**

In accordance with IRS regulations, the FF enforces a strict “No Refunds” policy for contributions made to the donor-advised fund. However, the FF recognizes circumstances where reversal of one or more transactions may be necessary. These include Charge Back and Gross Error transactions. 

A Charge Back transaction occurs when the credit card holder files a dispute with their bank stating that either they did not authorize or recognize the transaction on their credit card or bank statement. The FF staff will provide supporting documentation in an effort to resolve the Charge Back case in favor of the Foundation. However, if the FF is unable to resolve such cases and the case is referred to arbitration, the FF will accept the Charge Back transaction. Further, the FF will, under its variance power and authority, not regrant any funds to the selected organization that has been charged back. If the Charge Back funds have already been distributed to the selected organization, no attempt will be made to compel the organization to return the funds since the distribution  of a the donation advisement is considered complete and unrestricted. However, the FF will not issue any further regrants of donor-advised funds until it receives additional funds from donors or other sources advised for the organization equal to the amount of the Charge Back.

A Gross Error transaction occurs when the credit cardholder / donor makes a transaction for an amount grossly different than the intended amount. For example, a donor makes a $10,000.00 donation instead of $10.00 donation. A Gross Error transaction DOES NOT include donation intended to be directed to one organization but  made to the wrong organization or fundraising page, containing an incorrect name, dedication, or designation, or any other non-financial reason. FF retains sole authority to determine the exact criteria of a Gross Error transaction. A Gross Error transaction refund will only be considered if FF has not yet regranted the funds to the designated organization (see “Tax-Deductible Contributions to Charitable Causes” section for more information on regrants). Once funds are regranted, the donor should contact the advised organization in order to attempt to correct the error. 

**Credit Card Anti-Laundering Policy**

Only the authorized credit card holder may donate on the Giving Day Website. A third party may not use the donor's card information or enter donations on behalf of the donor. This practice is known as "credit card laundering" and violates Visa and MasterCard usage agreements. FI  may report any such abuses to the appropriate authorities. This restriction does not preclude the use of computer terminals or kiosks, with access to the Giving Day Website, for the authorized credit card holder to utilize in order to make a donation. 

**No Goods and Services in Exchange for Donations to Charitable Causes**

Federal law prohibits charities from promising or providing goods and services (e.g., tickets to events or raffles) in exchange for making a donation to a donor advised fund such as Firespring Foundation. FF may only accept pure contributions and not part gift and part sale transactions. 

**Privacy of Donor Information**

Privacy and security of donor information is of vital importance to us. We will not share names of donors with anyone other than the Client and the Registered Charities, except in conformity with the policies set forth in this section of the Terms of Use and in no event will we, the Client and the Registered Charities ever sell your information to anyone. When you contribute to any cause on the Giving Day Website, you grant us permission to access your donation records at any time and to use the information you provide to process your donation. FI or FF will make available to the Client and the Registered Charity reports identifying, your name, address, email, and transaction accounting details. FF, the Client and the Registered Charities that ultimately receive your donations shall have the right to identify and publically acknowledge you as a donor in their discretion, unless you elect, at the time of your donation, to make the gift anonymous, in which case we, the Client and the Registered Charity agree not to publically disclose your name or your gift.   

If you are a Registered Charity Admin, donor information will be shared with you via a report accessible on your Registered Charity Page or Fundraising Page on the Giving Day Website.  

**Firespring Foundation Financial Information**

FF files the annual Form 990 with the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS Form 990 will be available on-line by [clicking here](mailto:legal@Firespringfoundation.org) and upon request by emailing legal@Firespringfoundation.org.
